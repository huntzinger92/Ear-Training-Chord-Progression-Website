This app is a tool designed to help music students learn how to identify a wide variety of chord progressions by ear. Unlike other online tools, this app gives the user a high degree of control over the settings with which chords are generated. Options include disabling/enabling inversions, randomized keys, and seventh chords, as well as choosing modal options or looping the playback (useful for playing along on their instrument).
